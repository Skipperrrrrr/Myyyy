    <h1>To the love of my life, Lorrie —</h1>
    <p>I don’t know when exactly it happened, but somewhere between those long walks, the times you laughed at my foolish jokes, and the days you said “you haven’t texted me all day,” I fell. I didn’t just like you. I didn’t just love you. I chose you.</p>
    <p>I’ve watched you grow, pray, love deeply, and serve with your whole heart. I’ve sat next to you in moments that were light, and others that felt heavy. And each time, I felt like I was where I was meant to be.</p>
    <p>You are not just beautiful. You are kind in the loudest and softest ways. You’ve made me a better man — and I’ve never stopped being amazed that I get to be loved by you.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I imagine our future — not as some perfect Instagram life, but as real as burnt rice, sleepy Sundays, early morning devotions with sleepy-eyed kids, and laughter echoing through a home we built together. I want that with you.</p>
    <p>You once asked me if I was sure.</p>
    <p>Lorrie… I am.</p>
